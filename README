WebService-Yelp version 0.01
============================

OVERVIEW

This module allows you to access Yelp's REST API for searching
business, location, and review information. Please see
http://www.yelp.com/developers/getting_started for information on the
API. Also be sure to read Yelp's Terms Of Use and Branding
Requirements. They will probably both apply to you if you plan to use
the data resulting from using this module.

TESTING

You'll need a Yelp Web Service ID (ywsid) in order to run the tests
(and use the module). The tests will automagically use the YWSID environment
variable, i.e.

export YWSID='xxxxxxxxx'
